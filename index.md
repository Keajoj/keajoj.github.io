    Always take care when walking alone

    Lest you meet those monsters in the woods

    They look beautiful at first

              (like snow)
    
    But then you see
    
    Their too long FACES
    
                            Their eyes all BLACK
    
    And you hear their  g A r b L e d   w O R d s
    
    like a   P
    
            A
    
           R
    
          O
     
         D
    
        Y    of you
        
        
    
    It's really such a terrible thing to know.
